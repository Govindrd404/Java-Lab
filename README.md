01) Bank.java-
Develop a Java program to create a class Bank that maintains two kinds of account for its customers, one called savings account and the other current account. The savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The current account provides cheque book facility but no interest. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.
Create a class Account that stores customer name, account number and type of account. From this derive the classes Cur-acct and Sav-acct to make them more specific to their requirements. Include the necessary methods in order to achieve the following tasks:
a)Accept deposit from customer and update the balance.
b)Display the balance.
c)Compute and deposit interest
d)Permit withdrawal and update the balance
Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty if necessary and update the balance.


2) Shape.java-
Develop a Java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and an empty method named printArea( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contain the method printArea( ) that prints the area of the given shape.

Create a class Book that contains four members: name,  author, price, and num_pages. Include a constructor to set the values for the
